# Virtual_Hand_Tracking_Calculator.
-> The Hand-Tracking Calculator is an innovative tool that utilizes computer vision and machine learning to allow users to perform basic arithmetic calculations through natural hand gestures. Leveraging OpenCV for video processing and MediaPipe's pre-trained hand landmark detection model, the system tracks hand movements and recognizes specific gestures to interact with a virtual calculator interface.
 Unlike traditional calculators, which rely on physical input devices such as keyboards or touchscreens, this calculator recognizes hand gestures—such as pinching, pointing, and swiping—to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. The system leverages MediaPipe to track key hand landmarks, including fingertips and the thumb, to detect gestures that simulate "clicks" on virtual buttons, making interactions completely touchless.
 
-> The core aim of this project is to create a fully functional virtual calculator that can be operated through hand gestures.
